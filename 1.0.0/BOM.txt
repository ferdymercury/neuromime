fabrication_output/
   -contains gerber output files, drill-files etc. for Neuromime 1.0.0, ready to send to a board house
   -may contain minor errors (eg. labelling etc.)
   -not really necessary if you want to use the files below to generate your own fabrication output
   -these are relabelled from KiCad default naming scheme in a way that is clearer, using a shell script to be posted in this repository at some point

INDEX.txt
   -this file

project_files/
   -KiCad project, board and schematic files; you will also need the libraries in the "../kicadlibs" folder and to set your path in the .pro file properly

neuromime_ARCHIVE_1.0.0.zip
   -KiCad project, board and schematic files; same as above folder but self-contained archive generated by KiCad with footprints and components, ie. no need for libraries in "kicadlibs" and be able to import directly into KiCad
