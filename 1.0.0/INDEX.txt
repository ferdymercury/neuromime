fabrication_output/
   -contains gerber output files, drill-files etc. for Neuromime 1.0.0, ready to send to a board house
   -may contain minor errors (eg. labelling etc.)
   -not really necessary if you want to use the files below to generate your own fabrication output
   -these are relabelled from KiCad default naming scheme in a way I feel is clearer using a shell script I will post here some day

   -KiCad project, board and schematic files, you will also need the libraries in the "kicadlibs" folder and to set your path in the .pro file properly

neuromime_ARCHIVE_1.0.0.zip
   -KiCad project files, same as above but self-contained archive with footprints and components, ie. no need for libraries in "kicadlibs"
