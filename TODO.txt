corrections and todo for Neuromimes version 1.0.0:
-correct refractory capacitor/resistor labelling to latency capacitor/resistor
-implement inhibition input complex (on non-inverting input of LM311)
-implement refractory period (with another 555 timer)
-add bill-of-materials, in the meantime contact the maintainer (Peter)

suggestions/ideas:
-use individual 555 timers instead of 556 dual timer, this way could use low power version of 555, low power 556 not available
-surface mount version
-inhibition complex as out-board module for version 1.0.0
-output module (eg. SSR) in same form factor
