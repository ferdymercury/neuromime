corrections/errors (Neuromime ver 1.0.0):
-correct refractory capacitor/resistor labelling to latency capacitor/resistor on top silkscreen layer
-correct axon labelling, top silkscreen layer

to do:
-implement inhibition input complex (on non-inverting input of LM311)
-implement refractory period (with another 555 timer)
-add bill-of-materials, in the meantime contact the maintainer (Peter)

suggestions/ideas:
-use individual 555 timers instead of 556 dual timer, this way could use low power version of 555, low power 556 not available
-surface mount version
-inhibition complex as out-board module for version 1.0.0
-make an output module (eg. SSR) in same form factor
-make a multiple cell board (eg. square or axonometric grid), with fixed number of external inputs and outputs, internal connections routable with jumpers, wirewrap connectors etc.

-high speed neuromimes, operating at, say, audio frequency (20hz-20khz)
-inspired by the "rate model", spiking neurons
-blinking lights become fading lights
-fiber optic connections then have variable strength (weights?) based on pulse frequency (LED brightness)
-could smooth high frequency (HF) neuromime outputs, connect directly to amp/speaker for wavering dissonant tones 
-HF outputs to dc motor speed (braitenberg?)

-add self-activation button on each neuron
-how to accomodate more than 3 I/O points?
-3D networks using bendable/rigid cabling or right-angle male-male headers, etc.
-neuromimes make Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are more biologically plausible than continuous ANNs
-SNNs are used primarily in neuroscience reseach, while continuous ANNs are currently more "practical" problem solvers, i.e. they are easier to train for certain prediction problems and entirely the basis for the AI "revolution" circa 2016
