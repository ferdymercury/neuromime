"red" neuromimes:
-quantity: 12
-implemented by Peter during EB residency, winter 2017 
-fiber optic output on axon B when 'cap' is selected w. axon B output jumper
-above jumper selects a 47 ohm resistor (soldered in place of 100uF cap)
-output PW cap, slow (red): 10uF
-output PW R, slow: 51K
timings:
		0.1uF	10uF
27K	2.97 mS	297 mS
51K	5.61 mS	561 mS

"blue" neuromimes:
-quantity: 9
-implemented by Peter for Stephen's 'Art and Artificial Life' class at NSCAD, summer 2017
-long output pulse
-output PW cap, slow: xxuF
-output PW R, slow: 47M
timings:
		0.1uF	100uF
27K	2.97 mS	xx S
47M	5.17 S	xx S
