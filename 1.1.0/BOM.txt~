DIGIKEY PARTS LIST (shopping cart):
http://www.digikey.ca/short/tzpq7t

NB:
-this list is incomplete and in progress; missing at least the output LED (we used a 3mm super birght white LED), mating connector for the power pins and 8 pin DIP socket
-the power connectors used in orginal neuromime boards were purchased in Taiwan and identical ones do not seem to be available on Digikey (see alternate connectors below)
-possible cheaper alternates for connectors listed below; it should be possible to source nearly everything in bulk for cheap on sites like Ebay and/or Alibaba

ALTERNATE CONNECTORS:
3.96mm orange ones (for power):
